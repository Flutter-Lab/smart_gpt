    "The Big Bang theory explains how the universe started from a hot and dense state around 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since. Proposed by Georges Lema√Ætre in 1927, it gained acceptance in the 1960s with the discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation. The theory suggests that all matter and energy were compressed into a singularity before a major explosion occurred, leading to the expansion of space and the formation of matter and energy. This expansion eventually gave rise to the formation of atoms, stars, and galaxies.";
